    },
    "Performance baseline is mapped (x) and can scale up to 10X": {
      "recommendation": "Expand your testing to include varied load conditions, ensure performance baselines are regularly updated, and validate performance in environments that closely mimic production to maintain accuracy and reliability.",
      "assessment": "Having a mapped performance baseline with scalability is a strong foundation, but it may not fully address the completeness of performance testing across different environments and conditions."
    },
    "We have an exact copy of the production environment in staging or have determined the scale-down factor between staging and production environments": {
      "recommendation": "Regularly update your staging environment to match production, simulate diverse and dynamic load conditions, and continuously refine your scale-down factors to ensure comprehensive performance validation.",
      "assessment": "A staging environment that mirrors production or a defined scale-down factor is excellent for accurate performance testing, but it may need enhancements to cover dynamic load scenarios and real-world usage patterns."
    },
    "We address all aspects of performance, including product responsiveness, baseline mapping, and staging environment replication": {
      "recommendation": "A comprehensive approach covering responsiveness, baseline mapping, and environment replication is ideal, but ongoing optimization and integration of these aspects are crucial for maintaining performance.",
      "assessment": "A comprehensive approach covering responsiveness, baseline mapping, and environment replication is ideal, but ongoing optimization and integration of these aspects are crucial for maintaining performance."
